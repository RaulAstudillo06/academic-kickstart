<p> I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the <a href="https://www.cms.caltech.edu/">Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences</a> at <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/">Caltech</a>, hosted by Professor <a href="http://www.yisongyue.com/index.php">Yisong Yue</a>. I earned my Ph.D. in Operations Research and Information Engineering from <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a>, where I worked with Professor <a href="https://people.orie.cornell.edu/pfrazier/">Peter Frazier</a>. During my Ph.D., I spent six months as a Visiting Researcher at <a href="https://research.facebook.com/">Meta</a>, collaborating with the Adaptive the Adaptive Experimentation team led by <a href="https://eytan.github.io/">Eytan Bakshy</a>.  Before joining Cornell, I completed the undergraduate program in Mathematics offered jointly by the <a href="http://www.ugto.mx/en/">University of Guanajuato</a> and the <a href="https://www.cimat.mx/en">Center for Research in Mathematics</a>. </p>

<p> My research interests lie at the intersection between operations research and machine learning. By integrating tools from both fields, I develop algorithms that enable intelligent decision-making in complex environments where information is costly to gather or process. My work has found application in areas such as cellular agriculture, materials design, and protein engineering. </p>

<p><b> Honored to be recognized as a Rising Star in Management Science and Engineering by Stanford University, and as a Rising Star in Data Science by the University of Chicago and UC San Diego. </b></p>

<p><b> I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market! </b></p>
