I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Computing + Mathematical Sciences Department](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/) at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/), hosted by Professor [Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/index.php). I recently obtained my Ph.D. in Operations Research and Information Engineering from [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), where I worked under the supervision of Professor [Peter Frazier](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/pfrazier/). Before that, I completed the undergraduate program in Mathematics offered jointly by the [University of Guanajuato](http://www.ugto.mx/en/) and the [Center for Research in Mathematics](https://www.cimat.mx/en).

My research interests lie at the intersection between operations research and machine learning, with an emphasis on Bayesian methods for efficient sequential data collection. Combining principled decision-theoretic foundations with sophisticated machine learning models, my work aims to develop frameworks for adaptive experimental design in complex pipelines arising in robotics, cellular agriculture, and many other scientific applications.
