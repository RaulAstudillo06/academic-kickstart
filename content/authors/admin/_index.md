I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/) at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/), hosted by Professor [Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/index.php). I earned my Ph.D. in Operations Research and Information Engineering from [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), where I worked with Professor [Peter Frazier](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/pfrazier/). Before that, I completed the undergraduate program in Mathematics offered jointly by the [University of Guanajuato](http://www.ugto.mx/en/) and the [Center for Research in Mathematics](https://www.cimat.mx/en). In 2021, I was a Visiting Researcher at [Meta](https://research.facebook.com/) within the Adaptive Experimentation team led by [Eytan Bakshy](https://eytan.github.io/). <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Visit W3Schools.com!</a>

My research interests lie at the intersection between operations research and machine learning, with a focus on algorithms for efficient sequential decision-making under uncertainty. More specifically, my work combines rigorous decision-theoretic foundations with sophisticated machine learning tools to develop modern adaptive experimentation methods. These  methods have found application in cellular agriculture, materials design, and protein engineering.
