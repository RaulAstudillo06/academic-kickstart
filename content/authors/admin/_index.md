<p> I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the <a href="https://www.cms.caltech.edu/">Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences</a> at <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/">Caltech</a>, hosted by Professor <a href="http://www.yisongyue.com/index.php">Yisong Yue</a>. I earned my Ph.D. in Operations Research and Information Engineering from <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a>, where I worked with Professor <a href="https://people.orie.cornell.edu/pfrazier/">Peter Frazier</a>. During my Ph.D., I spent six months as a Visiting Researcher at <a href="https://research.facebook.com/">Meta</a>.  Before joining Cornell, I completed the undergraduate program in Mathematics offered jointly by the <a href="http://www.ugto.mx/en/">University of Guanajuato</a> and the <a href="https://www.cimat.mx/en">Center for Research in Mathematics</a>. </p>

<p> My research focuses on adaptive learning and decision-making in complex, data-intensive environments, with applications spanning personalized healthcare, engineering design, and scientific discovery. In recognition of my contributions, I was named a Rising Star in Management Science and Engineering by Stanford University and a Rising Star in Data Science by the University of Chicago and UC San Diego. </p>

<p><b> I will be joining the <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/research-department/machine-learning-department/">Department of Machine Learning</a> at <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/">MBZUAI</a> as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in August 2025. I am currently recruiting motivated students and postdoctoral researchers. If you are interested in working with me, please reach out via email with your CV. </b></p>
