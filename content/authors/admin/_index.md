I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the [School of Operations Research and Information Engineering](https://www.orie.cornell.edu/orie) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Peter Frazier](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/pfrazier/). Prior to coming to Cornell, I completed the undergraduate program in Mathematics offered jointly by the [University of Guanajuato](http://www.ugto.mx/en/) and the [Center for Research in Mathematics](https://www.cimat.mx/en). My current research focuses on the design and analysis of Bayesian optimization algorithms for problems with nested objective functions.
