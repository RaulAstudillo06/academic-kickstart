 abstract = {We consider multi-attribute Bayesian optimization, where each design in an optimization
problem’s feasible space is associated with a vector of attributes that can
be evaluated via a time-consuming computer code, and each vector of attributes
is assigned a utility according to a decision-maker’s utility function. A standard
Bayesian optimization approach could be applied if the utility function were known
to us: we would place a Bayesian prior distribution over the composition of the
objective function, which returns a design’s vector of attributes, and the utility function,
which maps those attributes onto a utility. In contrast, we assume the utility
function cannot be evaluated and is known implicitly only to the decision-maker.
We propose a Bayesian optimization algorithm that chooses the designs to evaluate,
such that the expected utility of the design chosen by the decision-maker, according
to our algorithm’s estimate of the objective function, is large. In contrast with
existing approaches for multi-attribute optimization that focus on estimating a
Pareto frontier, our approach can take advantage of prior information about the
decision-maker’s utility, obtained from past experiences with the decision-maker
or from a utility elicitation process.},
