abstract: We introduce mixed integer linear programming under preference uncertainty,
  a novel approach for supporting decision-making when the decision-maker's preferences
  are uncertain. Here, each feasible design is associated with a vector of attributes,
  and each vector is assigned a utility through the decision-maker's utility function,
  which has been incompletely estimated through preference learning, and whose remaining
  uncertainty is quantified by a Bayesian prior or posterior probability distribution.  We
  develop new optimization-based algorithms with theoretical guarantees that provide
  a menu of diverse solutions among which the decision maker is likely to find a solution
  that performs well according to her preferences.
